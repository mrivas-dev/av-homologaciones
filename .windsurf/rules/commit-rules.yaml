# When to use body
body-guidelines: |
  Use the body to explain WHAT and WHY vs. HOW.
  - Focus on the "why" behind the change
  - Include any relevant context or background
  - Mention any trade-offs or alternatives considered
  - For larger changes, include before/after examples

# Additional Notes
notes:
  - Keep commits small and focused on a single logical change
  - Use the imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds")
  - Consider using a commit template in your IDE
  - Reference issues and pull requests in the footer when applicable
  - Use emojis in commit messages if your team prefers them
